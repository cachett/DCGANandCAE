Introduction
I have implemented two commonly used generative models using Pytorch:

A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09535
A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434
The dataset I use is the CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
